# Fast-Jira

### What is it?

A jira desktop client for Windows

### Why?

Because the browser version of jira is a travesty where everything takes several seconds to complete.

### What's the drawback?

It's obviously not as powerful as the browser version. This is more for people *reading* issues, but if you mainly create and edit issues then the browser version is the way to go.

### Installation

There is no installation - just unpack and start, then edit the settings to enter your server and username. Done!
